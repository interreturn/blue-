      tvAnswer5: "You have an optimistic mental outlook, which helps you to maintain your physical health, as the two are intertwined. You need to manage your stress levels to ward off diseases. Getting enough sleep will be very beneficial to this end. Otherwise, your physical health is generally very good. For best health, make sure to avoid alcohol, high fat foods, and other drugs.",
      tvAnswer6: "Dress with authority at work. Wear sensible shoes and power suits and don’t worry about fashion. Make sure you find a way to add your own unique style to your work attire. Men should add bold, colorful ties. However, in your personal life, you enjoy a sense of flair and really like to show off your unique style. Bold colors define you.",
      tvAnswer7: "You are strong, motivated, and a very talented leader. These qualities can serve you well in a career in the military or law enforcement. You are also well suited for any career that allows you to use your enthusiasm for doing something on your own, such as a business owner, contractor, or management position. You could also be a talented graphic artist or photographer.",
      tvAnswer8: "Your two dominating qualities are your sense of adventure and your passion. Your partner needs to understand that you’d rather climb a mountain than have a quiet evening at home. Your passion shows up in over-the-top displays of affection. You enjoy romantic getaways with your lover. People who are drawn to you are impressed with your kindness and your air of authority.",
      tvAnswer9: "Wealth is part of your future. You are great at building a financial base, but also adept at losing it and being forced to start over. You have to be willing to work hard to make your ideas profitable, as you have great ideas, but people have a hard time believing in them because they tend to be unconventional. You are comfortable taking risks, which helps you build your fortune."

      tvAnswer5: "You tend to be an anxious person and need to control these tendencies, as they can cause you to have physical issues. To maintain both your physical and mental health, pay attention to your lifestyle and the atmosphere you live in. These have profound effects on you. Eat plenty of seasonal fruits and linseed for optimal health. You are naturally more susceptible to health issues.",
      tvAnswer6: "You don’t like being the center of attention and your wardrobe choices reflect this. You tend more toward classic, timeless styles. Muted tones such as earth colors, neutrals, and pastels are best for you. Women should look for natural chic, flowing and comfortable clothing and enjoy showing off your feminine side. Men look great in comfortable sweaters. Add accessories that show your artistic side.",
      tvAnswer7: "You are strong, resilient, and a great diplomat. You have a great ability to show compassion to others, which is beneficial to you in a variety of careers, including health care, teaching, counseling or social work, caregiver, or therapist. Because you are personable in nature, you also make a great real estate agent, bartender, waiter, or politician. Once you choose a career, it is likely to be for life.",
      tvAnswer8: "You are very guarded and tend to keep your feelings hidden. This makes it difficult for people to get close to you. If you have been hurt in love before, you have a hard time getting over it and may not want to be in a relationship at all for fear of being hurt again. You make a better friend than a lover and people rely on you for advice.",
      tvAnswer9: "You love to live the luxurious life, but have difficulty maintaining wealth. If you aren’t careful, you will go into debt to maintain an extravagant lifestyle you can’t afford. You also like to help out others, so you may give away your money before you have a chance to gain any financial stability. Use diplomacy to get people on your side and help you use your ideas to build your fortune."

      tvAnswer5: "Your mental health is best served by working independently. You get easily frustrated working with others. Also, make sure to guard against your ego; it will lead you the wrong way. For best health, you intuitively know what you should do. Avoid fatty foods and eat a well-balanced diet to maintain your well-being. If you take care of yourself, you will have good health throughout life.",
      tvAnswer6: "You need to balance your unique fashion sense with a little bit of discipline. You do best by adding a touch of flair to more conventional outfits. Men and women both can get away with the jeans and t-shirt look, but don’t dress down too much. Wear stylish shoes with this outfit for your best look. Incorporate your creative energy in your wardrobe.",
      tvAnswer7: "You are creative and unconventional, which means you will get bored with routine quickly. This means you need a career that is unpredictable and unconventional. You would do well in a career in many different artistic endeavors, including working in the media. With your intelligence and genuinely curious nature, you will also excel in careers in the sciences and psychology.",
      tvAnswer8: "You attract many people to you because of your positive, fun-loving attitude. You enjoy life and have a hard time being tied down to one single person, as you fall in love very easily. You love to be around a lot of people and enjoy impressing those that you care about with grandiose expressions. Deep inside, you are a romantic.",
      tvAnswer9: "You are very charismatic, which helps you to accumulate wealth easily and naturally. However, guard against spending it as quickly as you get it. You feel that you can always make more, so you aren’t concerned with saving. Don’t fall into the debt trap. If you learn a few saving skills, you will amass a fortune. If you acquire a marketable skill to go with your charisma, you’ll be rich."

      tvAnswer5: "Don’t abuse your body with a lavish lifestyle and you will enjoy good health. You are strong and have great physical endurance and inner vitality. Take care of your body and it will take care of you. Guard against worrying about getting sick. You are much stronger than you think. Practice meditation and avoid spicy and fatty foods for optimal health.",
      tvAnswer6: "You have clothes in your closet for every occasion and have a taste for quality over fashion. However, this also translates into functional clothing that demonstrates no sense of style. Women should have a little black dress and men should have a fitted blazer for nights on the town. You have a great supply of sensible shoes. Buy something unusual to add to your bland wardrobe.",
      tvAnswer7: "Your biggest gift is your attention to detail. You also thrive on routine and have a great deal of discipline. You are determined and don’t mind doing the hard work to achieve your goals. You are also very organized and like everything in its place. This makes you well suited for a career in the sciences, athletics, accounting, engineering, and organizational and management positions.",
      tvAnswer8: "You tend to have difficulties in your love life because you focus your life around your career rather than your social circles. If you are looking for love, you need to get out and meet more people because you tend to be reclusive. Love can be more of a business proposition and you would do well with someone who enjoys a very traditional relationship.",
      tvAnswer9: "Material wealth is important to you, and you work hard to attain it. Because you work so hard, you understand money’s worth and are a good saver, meaning you will be able to acquire plenty of money. If you slack at any point in life, you risk losing all that you have. Your intelligence helps you to maintain your wealth through wise investments and financial planning."
    },
    5: {
      tvAnswer5: "You will experience general good health throughout your life. Be very mindful of your diet, as eating heavy foods and consuming alcohol are bad for your health. Green vegetables, barley, and carrots are important in your diet. Be sure to eat at regular intervals. You tend to be overly stressed, anxious, and may have to deal with anger management issues. Yoga and meditation are particularly helpful for you.",
      tvAnswer6: "Both men and women look for sexiness in your wardrobe and enjoy a good pair of sandals over any other shoe. You also have a tendency for more outlandish styles and enjoy the bohemian look. Women may even enjoy the vintage look. Men look good in colorful patterns. Make sure to keep a few outfits that are more conventional so that you are prepared for every occasion.",
      tvAnswer7: "You are a risk-taker and hate routine. You feel called to work in a field that requires travel or being in the outdoors. You love to meet new people and try new things. This makes you well suited for a career in travel, as a park ranger, advertising, public relations, and some high-risk ventures such as professional gambling, firefighting, stuntman, or construction worker.",
      tvAnswer8: "You are a free spirit and have difficulty being tied down and living a conventional life. Any partner you become involved with would do best to understand this nature and allow you the freedom to do what you want. You will feel stifled if you become involved with someone with a jealous streak. You have a unique style that people are drawn to.",
      tvAnswer9: "Money comes to you easily. You are a bit of a gambler and take risks that pay off. However, your biggest challenge is keeping your fortune. If you learn to use a bit of discipline and restraint, you will not only have a large fortune, but will be able to keep it as well. In this case, look for high-risk, high-reward investments."
    }, 6: {
        tvAnswer5: "You are generally in good health, but have more of a tendency to suffer small illnesses, such as colds, regularly throughout your life. You can control this by minding what you eat. Green vegetables need to be a staple of your diet. You help your mental and physical well-being by surrounding yourself with beautiful things that feed your soul. For best health, be sure to guard against anxiety.",
        tvAnswer6: "You have a simple fashion sense and shy away from provocative and bright clothing. Natural, traditional styles serve you best. Your biggest focus in your wardrobe is comfort. You don’t follow the latest trends and prefer to go with what you like. Although you go for simple, you have a good sense of what looks great on you. Both men and women look good in the color royal blue.",
        tvAnswer7: "You are personable, compassionate, and nurturing. Your main focus in life is to please others and make them feel happy and comfortable. You are also very responsible and should look for a career that values these traits. You are especially drawn to the healing arts or teaching, but would also excel in jobs that require you to use your hands and your intellect, such as engineering.",
        tvAnswer8: "Fairy tales are not your style. Instead, you are more practical and would do best to date someone who has the same interests as you do. You are ruled by your sensibility and common sense. You are slow to fall in love, but once you do, you are devoted until the end. Extravagant dates aren’t your style. Instead, a quiet evening home alone is for you.",
        tvAnswer9: "You never seem to have a problem getting money. It always just seems to be around. You do work hard for what you have, however. You use your intelligence and follow the rules to get what you desire most. You may have access to family money, which eases your worries. You tend to be stable, with no extreme highs or lows. You won’t be rich, but you won’t be poor."
      },
      7: {
        tvAnswer5: "The best thing you can do for your health is to learn to take it easy. You tend to be excitable and get overstimulated easily. Take time between activities, get enough rest, and learn a relaxation technique. Also, avoid drugs and other intoxicants which can exacerbate these issues. Sleep, fresh air, plenty of water, and simple foods are best for your needs.",
        tvAnswer6: "Fashion sense is not your forte, preferring to focus your mind on more intellectual pursuits. At home, both men and women prefer sweats and a t-shirt. However, when the occasion arises, you have class and go for the traditional look, rather than following the latest trends. Women should make sure to show a little feminine touch when they go out. Men prefer natural fabrics to synthetics.",
        tvAnswer7: "You’re a dreamer and a problem solver. You’re brilliant and love to come up with new ways to deal with problems. You’d do well in any number of careers, and would do very well in any one of the science and mathematics. You will also excel in a career that calls for strategizing, such as business or military strategy. You’ll also enjoy a career in commercial arts and performing arts.",
        tvAnswer8: "You hold your emotions close to your chest and don’t reveal them, which can make it hard for someone to fall for you. Your partner will probably show more affection than you do. However, you are devoted and will do almost anything to make your partner happy. You aren’t much for expensive dates. Instead, you enjoy taking your partner to spend time with friends.",
        tvAnswer9: "Accumulating wealth is not your highest priority. You are able to earn a lot when you put your mind to it, but you have chosen to focus your life elsewhere. You are as likely to be rich as poor because of this lack of focus. You could even make millions. Make sure to mind your money and use it only for ethical purposes."
      },
      8: {
        tvAnswer5: "Early to bed and early to rise is the prescription for you. Plenty of rest is essential for your continued well-being. Also, make sure to get plenty of exercise and spend time outdoors getting plenty of fresh air. These things will go a long way to maintaining good health. Also, avoid intoxicants of any kind. Maintaining a simple lifestyle is also necessary for optimal well-being.",
        tvAnswer6: "You are dressed for success. Expensive clothes with designer labels fill your closets. You need to be sure not to spend more money on clothes than you can afford. You love to use clothing to garner attention. However, make sure not to go too over the top. Women should make sure not to dress too provocatively. Men should opt for solid colors and avoid stripes and prints.",
        tvAnswer7: "Your biggest skills lie in being powerful and authoritative. Highly focused and ambitious, you need to be sure to give enough time to your personal life or risk getting lost in work. You would do great in a job requiring these skills, such as being a business leader, high-ranking law enforcement or military work, or upper management in any company. You’ll also excel as a surgeon or psychiatrist.",
        tvAnswer8: "You have a jealous streak because of your controlling nature. You expect to find true love and think your partner should be completely honest and loyal. You will get upset by anything less than this. If you want to find a lasting love, you need to ease up a bit or risk driving away people before they get a chance to know you.",
        tvAnswer9: "You seem to have access to money to meet your basic needs, but without hard work, you will not get beyond this. You desire material satisfaction, but don’t work as hard as you need to get rich. You live by the adage “You have to spend money to make money,” but it doesn’t always work out. Focusing on your dreams and being patient are your best bets to building wealth."
      },

        tvAnswer5: "For best physical health, take care of your mental health. Anxiety is something you need to guard against. You are a sensitive soul, which can make you prone to many illnesses. Avoid alcohol and fatty foods to maintain optimal health. Add garlic, onion, green chilies and coconut water to your diet. Maintain a cool temperature in your environment; you are more susceptible to heat.",
        tvAnswer6: "Utility is more important than style. You think very little about your wardrobe and don’t want to spend too much money on clothing. As a humanitarian, you will often be seen sporting a shirt with a cause printed on it. When dressing up, both men and women should choose simple clothes, timeless outfits. Simple doesn’t have to be slovenly, and you can show this style off well.",
        tvAnswer7: "Your biggest assets are your generosity and your desire to help others and are drawn to work as a humanitarian. Others find you self-sacrificing and caring.

Careers best suited for you include working in human resources, social work, anthropology, coaching, or the visual arts.",
        tvAnswer8: "You are passionate and have a deep romantic streak. You are the kind of person who likes to sweep your partner off their feet. You have a relationship people love to talk about because of its extravagance. You know how to get the person you want and will pull out all the stops to show off your passions. You will live happily ever after.",
        tvAnswer9: "People think you have the Midas touch, and always seem to have a regular flow of income. This is partly due to luck and partly due to intelligent career decisions.
